Just built it, record it so I don't forget it this time next year.

Server: AWS (free for one year, build a new one in the second year, free for another year, and so on)
Points to note:

Choose a server in the United States: For other servers, such as Canada, the Baota panel may not be able to connect, and there may be problems with the subsequent environment installation. You will need to reinstall servers in other regions, which is more troublesome.
Choose Amazon's system, don't choose Ubuntu or CentOS...
