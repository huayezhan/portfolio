**What I do**: When I first joined the company, a new project was initiated based on a ROS competition car. My work involved debugging the integration of hardware and software for the car, as well as writing tutorials for the ROS-based car.

    I can list some features of the ROS car:
    Advanced Development of ROS Robot System
    3D Mapping and Navigation
    Mecanum Wheel Omni-Directional Movement
    Robot Voice Interaction Control
