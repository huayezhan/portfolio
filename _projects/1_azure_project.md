This project focuses on using **Azure Data Factory (ADF)** to manage and process COVID-19 data. As you can see in this screenshot of the Azure interface, there are several components: **ADF, Azure SQL database, Azure Databricks, Log Analytics Workspace, etc**. These resources align with a **data pipeline architecture**, combining ADF for ETL, SQL for structured storage, and Databricks for analytics.

Unfortunately, I cannot create the Azure HDInsight cluster with the Student subscription. :(

[Reason:Â With an Azure Student subscription, you will initially be able to access only Azure services that are available with a free tier of service use.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/179055/can-i-use-a-student-subscription-in-azure-to-creat)
